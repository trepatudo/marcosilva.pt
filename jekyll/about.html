Since my 10 years old (2000) I got a big interest in coding. I love building stuff, both hardware and software. Started with mIRC scripting as it as something good to start (great manuals!) later on, as everyone that started on mIRC scripting I&rsquo;ve moved to PHP3 with the interest on the web servers and IRC servers I decided to rent my first server with 14 years old, a big cost for my age but easily covered once I started selling services for IRC and games (bouncers and game servers), within an year I&rsquo;ve become very interested in Linux (specifically RHEL[CentOS]) and started to study it deeply, it was just a matter of time until I moved entirely to work in Linux.
